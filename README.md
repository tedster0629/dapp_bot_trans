# **Important NOTE**
An app I developed that is running over legacy Coinbase's Toshi (currently replaced by Wallet), designed to support and log all transactions involved in international freight transport. The interface for the app is fully conversational and features multi-party, role-based permissions, and a step-by-step follow-up of the whole process.
